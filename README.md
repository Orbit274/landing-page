Leonard — Landing Page

Files:
- `index.html` — Main HTML
- `styles.css` — CSS with color palette and responsive layout
- `images/` — image assets (leonard-logo.jpg, leonard1.jpg .. leonard5.jpg)

Preview:
- Open `index.html` in a browser (or run a simple static file server, e.g. `python3 -m http.server` in this folder) to preview.

Notes:
- Uses Google Fonts (Roboto). To change typography, edit the `<link>` in `index.html` and adjust font-family in `styles.css`.
- Colors and sizes are defined in CSS variables at the top of `styles.css` for easy tweaking.
- Responsive breakpoints are at 940px and 560px.

If you'd like, I can add more pages, a contact form, or a small JS file to wire up the "Sign up" buttons to an email form or modal.
